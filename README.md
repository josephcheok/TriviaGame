# TriviaGame

This is a trivia game with 10 questions that shows only one question at a time until the player answers it or their time runs out.

- On selection of an answer, a screen will appear with the relevant gif and facts displayed in relation to which answer is correct.

- If the player runs out of time, the player is notified that time's up and the correct answer is displayed.

- After a few seconds, the next question will be displayed without user input.

- On the final screen, the number of correct answers and incorrect answers are displayed and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

## Technologies Used

There is a lot of customised JavaScript functions built for this game with the use of setInterval timers.

The quiz questions are put into an array and the trivia game can be expanded with additional questions (along with the location of the relevant gif) added into it.
